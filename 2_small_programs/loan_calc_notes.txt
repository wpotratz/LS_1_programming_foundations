  You'll need three pieces of information:
  - the loan amount
  - the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
  - the loan duration
  
  From the above, you'll need to calculate the following two things:
  - monthly interest rate
  - loan duration in months

PROMPT welcome and informational
GET user name
  SET user name = 'user_name'
PROMPT greetings to 'user_name'

GET loan amount
  WHILE loan_amount is invalid
    PROMPT to get a valid loan amount from the user
  SET loan amount = 'loan_amount'

GET APR
  WHILE apr is invalid
    PROMPT to get a valid apr from the user
  SET APR = 'apr'
  SET 'monthly_interest' = 'apr' / 12

GET loan duration AS selection of amount of months or years, and selection of months or years.
  REQUIRE input format 'amount time_specification' ex '15 months' or '2 years'
  WHILE loan duration is invalid
    PROMPT to get a valid loan_duration
  PARSE input separated by `space`
  SET amount = 'duration'
  SET time specification = 'time_spec'
  IF 'time_spec' is years
    SET 'loan_duration' = 'duration' * 12
  ELSE
    SET 'loan_duration' = 'duration'

USE `P = L[c(1 + c)n]/[(1 + c)n - 1]` to calculate the monthly payment and SET P = 'monthly_payment'
monthly_payment = (loan_amount * (monthly_interest(1 + monthly_interest)**loan_duration)) / ((1 + monthly_interest)**loan_duration - 1)

USE `B = L[(1 + c)n - (1 + c)p]/[(1 + c)n - 1]` to calculate the remaining balance of the 
loan after each payment, and SET B = 'balance'
balance = loan_amount * ((1 + )
